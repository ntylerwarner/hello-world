# hello-world
First step in my career as a coder. 

Hello world, 

My name is Tyler. I graduated with a degree in Finance in May 2015 and have since essentially been jobless. I've struggled to hold down a job because my lack of experience in finance and accounting. I've since decided to blaze a new trail in my career and become a computer programmer. I have no regrets about studying finance, and I won't feel guilty or ashamed when people tell me "You should have studied computer science." My finance degree has taught me to be a very shrewd money manager, and has taught me the psychology behind money and how people react to it, both very important skills in business. 

I've learned it's never too late to start anew, so while I'm still young I'm going to learn computer science and go down an ever expanding road to career success. I'm wrtiting a science fiction book, and I enjoy going to concerts and sports games to stay sane. Looking forward to my new life as a developer. 

Sincerely
Tyler Warner
